    "PAGE_INTRODUCTION": "<p>Hi! I'm Federico.</p><p>My journey into software development began with a spark of curiosity in a place that would shape my future: Blender. Just a few years after its release, I discovered this powerful 3D tool and was instantly captivated by its possibilities. As I designed intricate 3D environments, I felt a growing desire to go beyond static visuals—I wanted to bring these digital spaces to life, making them interactive, dynamic, and accessible from any device. That vision fueled my passion for programming, setting me on a path to turn imagination into interactive experiences.</p><p>I first specialized in back-end development, particularly with Spring Framework, where I learned to design robust, secure, and high-performance systems. Yet, something was missing: the connection between 3D and the server. It was only when I entered the professional world that I found this missing link—through front-end development. Working on large-scale projects allowed me to gain solid experience in building reliable and efficient applications while exploring innovative ways to present data.</p><p>Today, my goal is clear: to build professional applications that integrate 3D to offer immersive and dynamic data visualization. I want to push the boundaries of how users interact with information, creating experiences that are not only functional but also captivating. My background, combining 3D creation, back-end, and front-end development, gives me a unique perspective and strong technical expertise to tackle these challenges.</p><p>I am passionate about merging the power of data with the beauty of 3D, and I am determined to keep innovating in this field.</p>",

            "PARAGRAPH_DESCRIPTION": "Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue to manage application state in a centralized and consistent way. It operates on the principle of a single, immutable \"store\" that holds the entire state of the application, making it easier to debug, test, and maintain complex applications. Redux uses a unidirectional data flow, where state changes are triggered by dispatching actions, which are processed by pure functions called reducers to update the state. This predictable pattern ensures that the state is updated in a controlled and traceable manner. Redux is particularly useful for large-scale applications with shared state across multiple components, enabling developers to manage state more efficiently and avoid prop-drilling. While it requires some boilerplate code, its ecosystem of middleware (like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga) and developer tools make it a powerful choice for state management in modern web development."
